  A portfolio was made in the lab task. The portfolio was constructed as a simple website which was made using the Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). The construction of the website included the use of several HTML tags, including the anchor tag, image tag, heading tag, table tag and unordered list tags.
	The Portfolio was made in the form of several individual webpages linked to each other using anchor tags. Each webpage contained certain pieces of information. The web pages could be opened from the home page and could also be accessed using a navigation bar that was visible on top of every page.
  The ‘Home Page’ consisted of a navigation bar on the top, which was followed by two headings (one h1 and the other h2) enveloped in horizontal lines. An image, which was aligned towards the right, was also pasted. These were followed by several anchor tags in the form of a list and contained the links to other pages. Each link was placed in separate divisions and given distinct background colors.
  The ‘About Me’ page also had a navigation bar on the top, followed by a heading and an image. This was followed by a very brief description about me and a link back to the Home Page. The ‘Academics’ page had a similar layout, with a navigation bar, a heading and an image. These were followed by the academic record represented in the form of a Table, followed by a link back to the main page. The gallery also contained a navigation bar, a heading and an image, followed by a set of (similar) images, and a link back to the Home page. The ‘Contact Info’ page had a similar layout, with the contact information proceeding the navigation bar, heading and image, and preceding a link back to the Main Page. Following are the screen shots of the rest of the pages.
